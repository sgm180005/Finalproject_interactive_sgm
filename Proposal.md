# Title
Rain Final Project
## Repository
<https://github.com/sgm180005/Finalproject_rain_sgm.git>

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- Particle
	- A 15x15 pixel green square that grows completely transparent after half a second has elapsed
- rain
	- the particles falls down from the top of the screan at random locations along the x axis
- trails
	- each particle leaves a trail of fading particles as it makes its way down the screen that randomly vary in length

## Challenges
- How to create and build the display of a pygame so that it has the correct dimensions and color
- How to create a particle that moves across the screen using class and ensuring that it fades within a certain amount of time
- Create a section of code that makes sure that the particles are immediately unrendered when they go past the end of the display

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The screen looks like the matrix and green squares don't lag my computer by the end of the three minute presentation that we're required to do.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
Randomized green particle reaches the bottom of the screen

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Import all the files from github
  2. Read through all the requirements needed to submit the project
  3. Finalize proposal 
  

- Week 2
  1. Implement docstrings that define what the class or function should be doing
  2. Code what the display and particle should look like

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create a trail and optimize code
  2. Make demonstration video
  3. Submit project through canvas

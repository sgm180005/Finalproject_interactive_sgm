# Title
 Final Project: Interactive Story
## Repository
<https://github.com/sgm180005/Finalproject_rain_sgm.git>

## Description
I want to make an interactive story with a square. The user can choose a set answer to interact with the square and based on that interaction the square will say different things that will change the ending the user gets. I want it to sort of be like the Stanley Parable but more to my skill level.
## Features
- Particle
	- A 15x15 pixel green square that glows different colours depending on how the user interacts with it. Red=angry Orange=stressed Yellow=happy Green=sick Blue=sad Purple=surprised Pink=inspired Brown=shame
- story
	- the particles falls down from the top of the screan at random locations along the x axis
- textbox and responses
	- the text that the square is saying should be in a box around the lower end of the game screen
  - there should be options for the user to pick how to respond to the things the square is saying

## Challenges
- How to create and build the display of a pygame along with the textboxes and responses 
- How to create a particle that changes colour depending on the responses
- Create a section of code that makes sure that the storyline of the game makes sense and doesn't jump around

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The user is able to get through a game with a square that changes colour depending on the choices the user inputs, and read the text and interactions clearly. Hopefully they'll be able to see the ending that they got and a quit or replay option.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
There is a square on the screen and the user is able to see text. Depending on their choice they will get 3 endings: Happy, Sad, or Neutral.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Import all the files from github
  2. Read through all the requirements needed to submit the project
  3. Finalize proposal 
  

- Week 2
  1. Write the story that the user should go through and how the interactions should look
  2. Code what the display, textbox, and particles should look like

- Week N (Final)
  1. Code so that the square will change colours (maybe shift into different colours)
  2. Code end screens, and replay and quit buttons
  3. Make demonstration video
  4. Submit project through canvas

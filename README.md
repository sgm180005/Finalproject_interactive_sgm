## Description
I want to make an interactive story with a square. The user can choose a set answer to interact with the square and based on that interaction the square will say different things that will change the ending the user gets. I want it to sort of be like the Stanley Parable but more to my skill level.
## Features
- story
	- the particles falls down from the top of the screan at random locations along the x axis
- textbox and responses
	- the text that the square is saying should be in a box around the lower end of the game screen
  - there should be options for the user to pick how to respond to the things the square is saying

## Challenges
- How to create and build the display of a pygame along with the textboxes and responses 
- How to create a particle that changes colour depending on the responses
- Create a section of code that makes sure that the storyline of the game makes sense and doesn't jump around

## Requirements
Ideal Outcome:
The user is able to get through a game with a square that changes colour depending on the choices the user inputs, and read the text and interactions clearly. Hopefully they'll be able to see the ending that they got and a quit or replay option.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
There is a square on the screen and the user is able to see text. Depending on their choice they will get 3 endings: Happy, Sad, or Neutral.
